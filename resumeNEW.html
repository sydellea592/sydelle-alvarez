			<h3 class="bio-text Gabriela"> A little about me...</h3>

			<p class="bio-text">I'm a born and raised New Yorker with a love for makeup which prompted me to start a beauty blog. I loved being able to share my passion with others online but I eventually wanted to grow more in developing my blog in terms of design. I became tired of the basic cookie cutter templates on wordpress and wanted to be able to have more creative contoll over the aesthetic of my blog. However, there was just one problem: I didn't know how to code or design! That being said, I enrolled in NYU School of Professional Studies to earn my diploma in Web Design and Development.</p>
